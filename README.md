## The Task

- Creating a Kanban-board *(trello clone)*


</br>

#### The Task Requirements/Goals:


- To build an application that works like a *"kanban-board"*, Similar to *[trello.com](http://trello.com).*
- By using jQuery, JQuery UI in JS and combine these skills to complete the assignment.

##### The user you should be able to do following:* 

- [x]  To drag the "cards" to **three** different ***"columns/lists"** *(todo, doing, done).*
- [x]  Click on a card to see its information **(dialog)**
- [x]  To look at different *tabs in a cards dialog* to get more information about it.
- [x]  To set a deadline for each card **(datepicker)**

## Requirements

*The completed solution shall implement the following:*

- [x]  jQuery UI **datepicker**
- [x]  jQuery UI **draggable and droppable**
- [x]  jQuery UI **dialog**
- [x]  jQuery UI **tabs**
- [x]  At lest **two effects** from jQuery UI

- [ ]  Layout/dispositon all created from Bootstrap
- [ ]  Design/colors & vectors all from Bootstraps "strandard theme"






</br>

#### Extra Challanges:
*If you want you can also build some or all of following functions:*

- [x]  The user can *create new **cards***
- [x]  The user can *create new **columns/lists** that also works to drag a card to*
- [ ]  The user can change the color on the cards with a colorpicker
- [ ]  The user can archive a card so it ends up in a separate archive
- [ ]  The user can "save" their kanban board, suggestion in localStorage or as a JSON-file, which late on is loaded the next visit.



</br>

## What is this?

###### The user can do following using this Kanban-board:
- Creating new cards and lists
- Deleting cards and lists
